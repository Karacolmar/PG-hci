Welcome to PG-hci!

This is the git repository for our project "Firedrills for Administrators" which is part of our Bachelor project. 

to run, you need the following packages: 
	- Python2.7 (https://docs.python.org/2/install/)
	- wxPython (https://wiki.wxpython.org/How%20to%20install%20wxPython)
	- matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
	- jsonpickle (https://jsonpickle.github.io/)
	
Also, this runs some batch scripts on an Oracle Database on a Virtual Machine. For license reasons, we can't publish the VM, so running a Drill will make the tool crash on your system. Or, if you have an Oracle Database, running a Drill will crash it. This tool is not designed to run on a live system, so DON'T.
